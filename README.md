# python-api-challenge

In this repository you will find 2 files: WeatherPy and VacationPy. Please, run WeatherPy first, as the script will download and store CVS file that will be used in VacationPy file.
This repository intents to download the API's available in Geoapify to identify beased on Coordinates, the temperature, HUmidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed of certain cities. 
Later on, you will find the data filted out by certain parameters to identify potential hotels within an 10,000 meters, as well as geo images to showcase the results.

General Backgroud:
The structure of my scripts are identical to the ones given in the Challenge folder. You will only find 1 addition in WeatherPy which are 4 graphs with it's lineal regression of the data requested in Requirement 1. (All dataset, Latitude vs Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed).
I intended to create a function to easily build the scatter plots on WeatherPy, but I failed in the intent. I kept it and commented it because I would like to come back at it and see if I'm able to fix it. For now, I would like to submit my challenge with the solution done in the longer way (without the function) but with the information complete. I apologyze for that, I'm still trying to have a better speed on my coding and debugging, it is still work in progress.  
I had to used some websites along the way, which I cited on the comments as well.
I develop this challenge on my own this time, did not team up with any classmate this time.

Thank you!
Laura
